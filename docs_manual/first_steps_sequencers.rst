Fill the form and click the "Create" button on the bottom right to create it.

In the list of sequencers, you can click the sequencer ID to see the sequencer details.
The "Flow Cells/Runs" tab shows the number of runs from this device.
Clicking on the tab will show a table with the flow cells/runs for this sequencer.
The blue button in the top left allows you to update or delete your flow cell as well as export it to JSON data, create a new flow cell.

The table of sequencers has a small gray button with a cog icon.
Click it to see the actions for the sequencer (e.g., delete or update).
